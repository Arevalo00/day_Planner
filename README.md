# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

When I started working on this project, I frist started by looking at the mock up. I study how it looked compared to the starter code we got, and the I started planning my next moves. 

Frist I got the starter code set up then I read the README which outlined all the things I needed in my day planner to work, the current day needs to display and the save button needs to save text to local storage and then finally the color needs to display the current.
